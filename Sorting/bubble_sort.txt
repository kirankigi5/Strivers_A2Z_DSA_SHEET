1. Push the maximum to the last by adjacent swapping

Time Complexity: O(N^2) [Worst complexity, Avg Complexity]

Optimization: In each iteration of the outerloop define a variable which keeps track if any swap is going to happen in the inner loop.
              After performing the innerloop loop if no swap has happened it means the array is already in sorted order, then exit the loop

Best Case Time Complexity of Bubble Sort after optimization is O(N)
