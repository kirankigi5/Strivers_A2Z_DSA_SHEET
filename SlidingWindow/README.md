# üéØ Sliding Window Technique

The Sliding Window technique is a computational method that aims to reduce the use of nested loops and replace them with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity.

## üìù Overview

- A sliding window is a contiguous sequence of elements of a specific size that moves from the beginning of the array to the end.
- The technique is particularly useful for solving array/string problems that require finding subarrays that satisfy certain conditions.
- It maintains a subset of items as your window and slides over the data to process it efficiently.

## üéØ Common Use Cases

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Array Sums | Finding subarrays with given sum |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Strings | Finding longest/shortest substring |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fixed Size | Maximum/minimum sum subarray of size k |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ Patterns | String pattern matching |

## ‚ö° Complexity Analysis

| Aspect | Complexity | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Time | $O(n)$ | Reduced from $O(n¬≤)$ |
| Space | $O(1)$ | Constant extra space |


| Type | Description | 
|------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fixed Size | Window size remains 
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ Variable Size | Window size changes based on conditions |
