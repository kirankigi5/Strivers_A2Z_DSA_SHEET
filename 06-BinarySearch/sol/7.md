### 🔢 Problem: Count the Number of Occurrences of a Target in a Sorted Array

Given a **sorted array** `nums[]` and a number `target`, return the **number of times** the `target` appears.

---

### ✅ Approach: Binary Search (2-Pass)

We’ll use binary search to find:

1. **First position** where `target` occurs (Lower Bound)
2. **First position** greater than `target` (Upper Bound)

The difference between them gives us the **frequency**.

### 💡 Code (C++) 

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int countFreq(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int lower_bound = n;
        int upper_bound = n;

        // 🔍 First binary search: Find the first index >= target
        int low = 0, high = n - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] >= target) {
                lower_bound = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // 🔍 Second binary search: Find the first index > target
        low = 0, high = n - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                upper_bound = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // ✅ Total occurrences = upper_bound - lower_bound
        return upper_bound - lower_bound;
    }
};
```

### 🧠 Time & Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value      |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| ⏱ Time     | `O(log n)` |
| 🗂 Space   | `O(1)`     |

---

### 🧪 Example

```cpp
Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 2 occurs at indices 1, 2, 3 → Total = 3
```

> This is essentially what `std::lower_bound` and `std::upper_bound` do under the hood in C++ STL!
